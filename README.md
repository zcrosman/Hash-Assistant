# Hash-Assistant

### Features

Hash-Assistant will locate stored Hashcat sessions and load them into an interface to choose from to easily continue cracking that may extend over a long period.

It can also automate several steps of the hash preperation for certain hash modes (Currently just WPA-PBKDF2-PMKID+EAPOL). 


### Setup

Update the directories of your Hashcat, Wireshark, and pcap files as needed in the first few lines of the script.

Some of the automation parts of the script require Wireshark and WSL to be setup.
